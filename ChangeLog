pvfs2-1.5.0
===============
- trove dbpf keyval changes:  The dbpf keyval implementation has been
  changed from using individual DB objects for each handle, to one
  DB object for all keyval entries.  This affects the storage format,
  and requires the pvfs2-migrate-collection tool to be run on storage
  spaces created previous to this release.
- sync coalescing: A new syncing feature has been added to the trove layer that
  provides better performance with metadata in high-load cases.  New options
  were added to the server config: TroveSyncCoalesce, CoalescingHighWatermark,
  CoalescingLowWatermark.
- added stranded bstream checking and handling.  This is useful for correctly
  reusing handles in failure cases.
- consolidate I/O paths through the VFS for read,write and readv,writev.
- added testsome, wait, and release functions to external interfaces
- fixes to karma and performance monitoring.
- better error handling on server and client and kernel module
- fixes to ownership flags on root directory.  Allow chmod to work.
- fixes for small io and non-contiguous io.
- fixes to sys-io state machine to prevent deadlock on the server caused by
  concurrent writes from the same client.
- replaced keyval strings with shorter versions to save space in the keyval
  database.
- cleanups to the kernel module: cleanup cache subsystem structures and
  functions.  Better error checking on to make module reloading more robust.
- fixes for fsck and fs-dump.
- better xattr support for 2.4 kernels
- added support for berkeley db environments with the pvfs2 bdbs, and using
  shared memory for db cache instead of mmapped file.
- better support for 64bit (esp. ppc64) platforms and 32/64 bit mixed env.
- better support for darwin (OS X)
- added configure options: --disable-aio-callbacks,  No check for aio callback
  support is done any longer. --enable-kernel-sendfile to configure for users 
  that want sendfile system call support, it is now disabled by default.
  Epoll is now the default if its available, otherwise poll is used,
  --enable-epoll and --disable-epoll now force without checking.
- Performance improvements for bmi_tcp: allow socket buffer size and tcp
  window size to be changed dynamically.  Use a pipe file descriptor
  for poll to prevent stalls.  Reorganize epoll to add and remove epoll
  watches.
- pvfs2-genconfig now supports --iospec and --metaspec options.  Also fixed
  some hostname sorting and range spec bugs.
- pvfs2-client: added --logstamp.  nonblocking statfs and mount support.
- handle allocation wasn't resulting in a uniform distribution.  Now we
  pick a server at random and then select the remaining handles in a
  round-robin fashion
- pvfs2-ping does better per-server error reporting and keeps track of errors
  better
- pvfs2-viewdist now fails gracefully on old systems without xattrs.  Also
  prints out handle number and filename for each datafile

pvfs2-1.4.1-pre1
===============
- ib: encode data structures to support heterogenous architectures

- fix case where pvfs2-fs-dump would fall into infinite loop
- added new pvfs2-viewdist and pvfs2-perror utility

- can disable server support at configure time
- various tweaks to make cross compiling easier
- Phil Carns contributed a new config file option (LogStamp) to select
  timestamp format
- By default we sync metadata (TroveSyncMeta yes) and not data (TroveSyncData
  no).  This configuration is a good compromise between reliability and
  performance for most workloads.
- Joachim Worringen's noncontig benchmark turned up several bugs now addressed
  in this release
- bugfix where pvfs2-chmod would cause all future operations to fail

  using ReiserFS as the underlying file system
- added more redhat checks for determining if we need to patch the
  kernel module code to work properly with particular releases
- FAQ documentation update


pvfs2-1.0.0
===========
- disabled mmap readahead cache by default; allow configure option to
  optionally enable it
- added support for handling several cases of file hole zero fills
  (i.e. sparse files)
- configured acache timeout to be 5 seconds by default through the
  vfs; sysint was already 5 seconds
- added karma program installation to make install target
- redhat 9 related changes (in order to work out of the box)
  - used some 2.6.x kernel code on redhat 9 2.4.x kernels, if detected
  - no longer mark pages as reserved on redhat 9 2.4.x kernels, as it
    causes an oops on their kernel (i.e. not necessary)
  - installed a wrapper script in place of the pvfs2-server that
    exports the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL environment variable before running
    the server(to avoid using the redhat NPTL library which is
    incompatible)
  - fixed make kmod{24}_install even if there are multiple UTS_RELEASE
    definitions in the version.h file (as there are in redhat 9)


pvfs2-0.9.0
===========

- better balancing (randomization) of data server selection when
  creating new files
- clean up a few request-related 8-byte alignment issues for alpha
- fixed an AMD64 kernel oops due to a bad cast
- cleaned up error code types in the exposed sysint and mgmt methods
  (using PVFS_error rather than int)
- added a setattr debugging mask and changed most detailed setattr
  debugging to use it
- added a mkdir debugging mask and changed most detailed mkdir
  debugging to use it
- added some inlined methods in PVFS_util (as they need to be used on
  both the server and the client) for getting the current time in
  PVFS_time format, encoding a PVFS_time as a version (finer grained
  than a 'normal' PVFS_time since we can use the high 32 bits), and
  decoding the version as a PVFS_time
- added a compatibility hack that _should_ allow no noticeable
  breakage on existing storage space, but will eventually migrate to
  the slightly new storage format over time
- modified client side sys-mkdir, sys-create, and sys-symlink to
  encode the mtime as a version when passing it to the server (so it's
  transparent from the server perspective)
- modified server side get-attr to decode the version read from disk
  back into an mtime (so it's transparent from the client perspective)
- modified mkspace method to properly version newly created root and
  lost+found directories
- modified the server side mkdir operation to return -PVFS_EINVAL if
  the object attr type is not a directory object
- vfs readdir modifications to detect directory version changes on
  listings; default behaviour is unchanged
- fixed bug in collection remove that didn't remove the collection
  information from the collection db (which manifested as having a bug
  where a collection that was once created and then removed could
  never be created again due to a lookup succeeding before it should)
- added documentation on how to create multiple file systems within a
  single pvfs2 storage space
- added documentation on return codes of the sysint methods
- pvfs2-mkspace improvements:
  - now requires a collection ID, storage space and a handle range
  - fixed types used to represent actual root handle and collection id
    to be the proper types, rather than integers
  - remove many defaults in favor of requiring cmdline options
  - replace atoi calls with strtou{l}l to accomodate larger values if
    specified
  - cosmetic output improvements
  - fixed mkspace method to make sure that we only use handle ranges
    that are both non-null, AND are not an empty string


pvfs2-0.8.0
===========
- adjusted mask values for event logging to skip 0 mask
- moved handle counting in statfs to server side so that it is
  done in parallel
- replaced uniq() subroutine in PAV to avoid recursion
- pvfs2-statfs cleanups and cast fixing
- pvfs2-shell-test: replaced a directory test
- add a clientcore_timing debug mask that only logs the operation
  timings from the pvfs2-client-core
- added some pts debugging
- fixed bad assumption in getattr-acache that might have looked at the
  wrong handle/fs_id during some operations (e.g. lookup)
- removed potential latency on system startup by trying to store temp
  config files in /tmp/ first rather than the current dir
- make sure that our error routines strip any known class error bits
  instead of deciding that they're unrecognized if set
- improved trove error handling
- improved pvfs2-server error handling
- fixed crash bug in our config parser that tried to strdup strings
  that might be NULL
- pvfs2-types.h header file simplification and cleanups
- extended buffer size of filename for use with mkstemp as it started
  failing on ppc with misc unexpected characters
- addition of a simple vfs test program that creates a file with a
  hole in it and tries to read from that hole (this demonstrates a
  currently known bug)
- addition of the same test program using only the system interface
- fixed some misc memory/resource leaks
- fixed test program ls.c and admin program pvfs2-ls.c to not issue an
  extra call to readdir on every run by fixing a slight logic bug
- added a directory version that is passed back from the server to the
  client on each successful readdir call and updated the client and
  server response structures and encoder to accomodate this
- ncache related:
  - increased ncache timeout from 5 seconds to 30 seconds by default,
    but keep it disabled by default (it's still experimental)
  - cleaned up the ncache and make it useable by the
    lookup/remove/create/mkdir/etc calls (if enabled)
  - added a flag to the client sysint lookup sm that records if the
    final object resolved was a followed symlink or not (regardless of
    if it was followed or not)
  - extended the ncache interface (lookup/insert/remove) to have the
    ability to have multiple entries with the same name with different
    handles based on some other tag (e.g. resolving a symlink object,
    rather than what it points to).  this is also not in use at the
    moment.  for now, no symlink objects will be inserted into the
    ncache.
  - added more ncache debugging
  - added a fastpath return from client sysint lookup method on ncache
    hit
  - updated and extended all ncache test programs to work with the
    changed API and fixed broken tests/verified that they still work
- kernel related:
  - fixed all warnings generated from compiling the pvfs2 kernel
    module under 2.6.9 kernels
  - removed write_inode method, as it was unused and probably won't be
    used
  - removed unused -v command option to pvfs2-ls
  - added command option -V (and --verbose) which can detect version
    differences in the directory being read and will report them if
    this switch is enabled
  - fixed misc compilation warnings on Opteron/AMD64 machines
  - added directory version to readdir downcall (passed from
    pvfs2-client-core)
  - removed include of modversions.h directly from pvfs2-kernel.h

- added arguments to the crdirent/chdirent/rmdirent operations that
  now can take optional parent atime/mtime/ctime fields
- added support on server *dirent operations that update the parent
  time attributes (if specified) on successful completion of the
  *dirent operation; null/zero time fields are not modified
- modified sys-create/sys-mkdir/sys-symlink/sys-rename/sys-remove to
  work with the new operations properly; in general,
  create/remove/rename operations updates the mtime and ctime of the
  parent directory, which is now properly supported
- moved some common server side attribute handling code into a macro
  to make it re-useable across several server state machines
- updated en{de}coding of modified operations
- remove sync calls on readonly trove operations
- added sanity check to kernel's device poll; makes sure the device is
  opened by only one user before returning valid results
- make the device's request list waitqueue non-exclusive, since poll
  waits as well
- some formatting changes on kernel error reporting
- added mmap-ra-cache support for partial cache fills on incomplete
  requests; misc mmap-ra-cache enhancements
- cast setparam values to uint64_t rather than int64_t in admin utils
- remove trove sync call on server side root handle check
- modify server side remove state machine to check the k_size of the
  dirdata object being removed if it's a directory to report early
  back to the client that the directory is not empty (if it's not)
- remove the readdir checks in the client remove path now that the
  server-side remove can tell us directly if a directory is not empty
- modified PVFS specific error routines to print the value of
  unrecognized error codes if encountered
- fixed memory leak on check_fs_id setparam
- fixed 64bit compile warnings (AMD64/Opteron)
- split msgpair debugging into it's own class (no longer part of
  'client')
- break out clientcore debugging into its own debugging mask
- fixed trove error codes
- give trove flush and resize operations the ability to create the
  bstream they're working with if it doesn't exist instead of
  returning an error
- fixed bug in (threaded) trove that did not properly reinitialize
  condition variables after the first finalize
- improvements to the storage space and collection removal code
- extensive trove cleanups and cruft removal
- check for error codes when doing server side getattr and reading
  metafile information; stop processing if an error is reached
- invalidate attr cache on write_at calls (never used)
- changed pvfs2-showcoll coll_id prints from hex to decimal
- kernel changes:
  - enable kernel readahead hints on mmap/execution (i.e. sequential)
  - initialize kernel module's request_list_waitq at declaration time
  - put large print statement into a macro for convenience
  - make all bufmap allocations GFP_KERNEL, regardless of highmem usage
  - use add_waitqueue_exclusive for the io_completion_waitq entries
  - clear random readahead hint on mmap

- added optional epoll() based socket management component (enable
  with configure option --enable-epoll on linux 2.6 systems)
- fixed configure bug that dropped default CFLAGS in some cases
- adjusted trove id generation to make it easier to log trove events
- fixed Makefile.in bug that caused pvfs2-server.c dependency

- adjustment of condition variable usage in trove-dbpf to avoid races
  similar to those found in job_testXXX()
- applied vim formatting patch to use spaces instead of tabs
- fixed pvfs2-server permission check to allow users of the same group
  to have access to other group members attributes (for listing)
- fixed incorrect/invalid error codes and error handling
- fixed pvfs2-server crash bug due to io state machine potentially
  freeing a reqsched id that was never posted
- added mgmt methods PVFS_{i}mgmt_get_dirdata_handle for retrieving
  the internal dirdata handle of a specified 'parent' object (if any)
- fixed pvfs2-server crash bug (race) in trove that could return an
  object on queue addition that has already been serviced
- extended server side mkdir state machine to create the internal
  dirdata dspace when creating the directory (rather than waiting for
  crdirent to create it if it doesn't already exist)
- added mgmt methods PVFS_{i}mgmt_create_dirent mgmt for creating
  directory entries at a low level
- fixed request scheduler's acceptance of the mgmt-remove-* operations
  while in admin mode (since these can be used in admin mode)
- extended mkspace (and thus pvfs2-mkspace program) to initalize a
  lost+found directory after the root directory is made
- kernel changes:
  - fixed credential usage bug that resulted in (seemingly random)
    permission problems when using the file system as multiple users
  - fixed a bug that appeared as data corruption due to mapped memory
    pages in use being swapped out under heavy memory load under 2.4.x
    kernels (and containing incorrect data on future accesses)
  - remove slab poison flag from debug allocators, as some kernels
    complain about how it was used
  - do not use kmap/kunmap calls if not configured for HIGHMEM, as
    some configurations cannot resolve these symbols


pvfs2-0.6.2
===========
- updated documentation for dist-simple-stripe.c and modified
  the basic distribution to use a single data file object.
- fixed error reporting in pvfs2-server that didn't understand pvfs2
  specific error codes
- extended request scheduler to allow operations to pass through
  without being scheduled (and allow the noop operations to work like
  this)
- disabled the (unused) device interface on server builds, reducing
  server run-time threads by one
- bmi optimizations: avoid polling in test calls if operations are
  complete, or no operations are complete but there are unexpected
  operations ready to be serviced
- extended the pvfs2-mkspace tool to be able to work with data and
  meta handle ranges separately (also extended the internal interfaces
  as necessary for this functionality)
- fixed bug in mkspace that could create the root directory dirent
  object in a non-meta handle range
- added client side attribute type checking that avoids contacting
  servers if we've determined that the operation we're about to
  perform cannot be performed on an object of the type we were told to
  work on.  e.g., a readdir operation will not be issued to the server
  if the getattr reports that the object we want to readdir on is not
  a directory.  most sysint operations now have this checking in place
- fixed crash bug on the server crdirent operation if passed a
  non-directory object type
- fixed race condition triggered when pvfs2-server is getting many
  more incoming operations than it has posted unexpected msgs for
- increase the default number of posted unexpected msgs by the server
- properly re-integrate and simplify the usage of the mmap-ra-cache,
  which wasn't working properly after the pvfs2-client-core re-write
- fixed crash bug on the server due to an unexpected error code coming
  out of pthread_cond_timedwait inside of job test calls
- modify configure script to append date and time information to non
  release builds (for more fine grained version information if needed)
- fixed acache usage in sysint create/mkdir/symlink operations
- open-cache remove now syncs (if necessary) after the remove, rather
  than just before
- removed duplicate 'open_cache' debugging keyword definition
- allowed client side logging (via PVFS2_DEBUGMASK/PVFS2_DEBUGFILE env
  variables) to append to the specified logfile, rather than
  truncating it if it already exists
- fixed bug in device test method that didn't properly adjust the
  outcount on failure; also added the number of bytes read on a failed
  (short) read
- started adding debugging code for printing out server side response
  structures (only getattr is currently implemented)
- kernel changes: added some debugging and simplified the
  handle_io_error macro.  also added translation of non-errno pvfs2
  error codes (should it get one) to avoid returning entirely
  incorrect error codes in some cases; avoid allowing -PVFS_ECANCEL to
  be passed down to the kernel code from the pvfs2-client-core.  use
  i_size_read to update file position on opens for append.  remove old
  code that manually updated the inode's file size on writes
- replaced debugging mask of cancelled i/o operations from io to
  cancel
- simplified pvfs2-statfs by retrieving all server statistics in one
  call, rather than separate ones for meta and data servers; also
  fixed reporting of server duties (previously all servers were
  reported as serving both meta and i/o data)
- added a start banner to pvfs2-client-core if client debugging is
  enabled.  this allows easier visual inspection of restarts in logs
- fixed bug when copying credentials to first make sure that they're
  valid in all sysint/mgmt calls
- added both server and client side (mgmt) operations to remove
  arbitrary pvfs2 objects and directory entries without prejudice
- added a 'pvfs2-remove-object' tool that can remove pvfs2 objects and
  directory entries (use is not generally encouraged)
- fixed pvfs2-fs-dump crash bugs when it fails to find some objects it
  was expecting to see
- adjusted the time that pav allows for copying binaries out to remote
  machines
- fixed bug bmi_tcp potential send deadlock under heavy loads
- added a mgmt method that allows parameter sets on single servers
  (rather than the previous one that allowed only all servers)
- extended pvfs2-set-debugmask program to have the ability to set the
  debug mask on a single server (rather than all) via cmdline options
- replaced TroveSyncMode configuration option with separate
  TroveSyncMeta and TroveSyncData options.  the default values are yes
  for both
- updated pvfs2-genconfig to reflect TroveSync* config option changes
- implemented understanding of the data sync mode option in the flow
  interface via the setinfo method
- modified pvfs2-server to pass data sync mode option to the flow
  implementation via setinfo on a per fs basis


pvfs2-0.6.1
===========
- misc. updates to msgpairarray and associated tools to allow for
  server side use

  all yet) are stored in a centralized table
- removed some deprecated test programs
- new pint-util.[ch] to contain utility functions shared between
  client and server
- some refactoring of server state machines (mainly crdirent) to allow
  for code reuse in other state machines
- no longer need to fix up generated html by hand
- fixed a bug that allowed an open through the vfs without the O_CREAT
  and O_EXCL flags to return -EEXIST (should be success in that case)
- added a file_open.c test program that tests opens in various modes
- error code cleanups (added PVFS_EACCES mapping to EACCES; moved
  PVFS_EDETAIL to be a non-errno error code)
- fixed pvfs2-ls to properly convert reported file times in user's
  configured system localtime, rather than in UTC
- fixed the kernel module information so that modinfo doesn't report
  many duplicate entries
- fixed server pidfile usage (-p cmdline option)
- fixed msgpair retries to properly delay between retry attempts
- added trove hooks to be able to peek at handles that will be
  allocated later
- cleaned up the remove state machine and removed an unnecessary
  allocation/copy
- fixed existing acache usage in the sysint calls to be more uniform;
  removed some overhead in the sysint
- fixed kernel device close to be aware if mounts are still active
- added more tests to pvfs2-shell-test that test deeply nested
  subdirectories
- added a method to determine the min handle recycle time across all
  configured servers' file systems
- changed code formatting rules to use spaces rather than tabs in vim
- fixed bug that didn't reload the cached config information on file
  system removal (i.e. unmounts)
- added a cmdline argument to pvfs2-client to specify the acache
  timeout to use at run-time (default is 0 milliseconds, which is
  effectively disabled).  this timeout is upper bounded by the min
  handle recycle time across all servers, and it can change
  dynamically as new mounts come and go
- fixed a bug that allowed servers to create internal storage objects
  outside of the meta handle ranges in some circumstances
- replace single element msgpair/array setup code where possible with
  a macro


pvfs2-0.6.0

- added missing non-blocking sysint declarations to sysint header
- made sysint test and testsome() calls more useable
- merged dev unexp polling/handling with system interface
- added PINT_sys_dev_unexp call that allows posting unexpected device
  messages so that they can be returned from the sysint testsome
  method in addition to completed sysint operations
- added a id_gen_fast_unregister macro that is a no op, to make the
  api more consistent with the id_gen_safe_* calls
- modified device driver to work properly in non-blocking mode from
  userspace by implementing the character device poll method and
  modified the pint-dev device interface to make sure it can handle
  the pvfs2 device in a non-blocking manner; added a no immediate
  completion option to the device interface; made test more efficient
  by not polling if no idle time is specified; check for poll errors;
  use proper buffer sizes for reads across the device
- added a method to free the mapped memory region on pvfs2-client-core
  shutdown (valgrind complained)
- modified all job uses of the id-generator to use the safe, rather
  than fast, methods (useful for several reasons including safe
  cancellation of already completed operations)
- modified the job_dev_unexp method to have (and honor) the no
  immediate completion flag if passed (used in the pvfs2-client-core)
- re-wrote pvfs2-client-core to use sysint non-blocking operations
- improved human readable size reporting
- allow human readable size reporting to optionally use si units
- added --si option to pvfs2-ls (similar to ls's --si option)
- added -H option to pvfs2-statfs (similar to du's -H option)

  still transitioning properly
- added support in the pvfs2-client for ignoring an upcall retry for
  an op already in progress (as opposed to servicing it multiple
  times)
- added kernel method that allows the cancellation upcall/downcall
  cycle to progress, ignoring the fact that a signal is pending (since
  the only time a cancellation is issued is when there's a signal
  pending)
- fixed kernel oops on setattr (signal) interruption by returning a
  valid error code in this case
- full acache cleanup, bugfixes, and thread-safety support
- allow the sysint post() method to complete an op if finished
  (i.e. all states are immed. completion) by adding it to the
  completion list (which test/testsome can retrieve)
- removed 'cached' attribute fields from getattr_sm object
- removed mostly duplicated code from shared-state-methods.c
- added support (testing only) for building a threaded client library
- gracefully terminate thread-mgr testing threads on errors (this is
  only really useful for graceful shutdown of the threaded client
  library)
- added a set_info option to bmi that tells it to be more aggressive
  when cancelling operations (bmi_tcp will now close sockets)
- fixed kernel bugs that didn't release the bufmap indices in use on
  some error paths (eventually caused all of them to be permanently
  used which caused hangs on I/O)
- extended msgpairarray code to only retry msgpairs that haven't
  completed already
- increased kernel module single operation timeout to be 60 seconds
  instead of 30 seconds (note: as a side-effect this also extends the
  amount of time you'll have to wait on interrupted operations via
  signal for now)
- added PVFS_strerror_r; an equivalent to strerror_r (the thread-safe
  strerror call) that handles PVFS_error codes
- added a simple file_write test program (tests are not in releases)
- always delay for 1 second before spawning the pvfs2-client-core from
  within the pvfs2-client to avoid filling dmesg with harmful looking
  errors while restarting (and re-opening the device file)
- new trove component called dbpf-open-cache that caches open file
  descriptors and db references; replaces dbpf-bstream-fd-cache,
  dbpf-dspace-db-cache, and dbpf-keyval-db-cache; fixes a few long
  standing file size and attribute bugs
- added a few missing admin tools to make install target
- more attribute debugging messages or server

- fixed makefile LD selection and html docs target
- fixed bmi deadlock that appears in multithreaded library
- fixed responsiveness of pvfs2 kernel driver device poll
- added new option to BMI called BMI_FORCEFUL_CANCEL_MODE to serve as
  a hint to modules to be more aggressive when cancelling operation
  (i.e., tell tcp to always close sockets when cancelling)
- renamed pint-bucket component to pint-cached-config
- enabled pint-cached-config on server side
- unified how autogenerated .c files are tracked across client and
  server builds
- fixed distclean for release tarballs so that it does not destroy .c
  files that cannot be regenerated without full cvs source

  per file
- added new null job type that can be used to manually trigger
  asynchronous state machine transitions

  are not tied to incoming requests
- refactored server crdirent state machine using nested state machines
  and a little bit clearer error handling
- added job functionality to reset timeout timer on pending jobs
- removed old "contig" encoder from source tree

- documentation updates: a new high availability document, faq update,
  guide update, manpages
- moved exported pvfs2-util string functions to private str-utils
- added permission checking debugging mask and keyword to debug what
  the server is doing on permission granting or failure
- modified cosmetic output of admin tool pvfs2-set-debugmask
- make sure pvfs2-client doesn't cause a hang on ssh logout due to
  improperly closed fds; this was fixed in the past but unfixed to
  report exec failures.  we can't do that anymore with this setup, so
  we'll have to either require an absolute path to the client
  (preferred), or scan the PATH ourself to be sure it can be found; or
  log to a file like the server
- added debugging regarding the handle re-use timeout
- increased the default handle re-use timeout from 45 to 360 seconds
- removed redefinition of the default handle timeout constant
- change permissions to reasonable defaults on newly created
  directories using pvfs2-mkdir
- extended pvfs2-cp to preserve src to dest permissions where
  applicable
- extended pvfs2-cp to allow symlinks to be copied to and from pvfs2
  (as the link target file, not as a link -- similar to normal 'cp')
- extended pvfs2-cp to truncate target files if they exist
- added a threaded vfs test program to perform heavy I/O on a single
  file
- fixed pvfs2-server to continue processing after recoverable
  BMI_testcontext errors
- added some gossip debugging along the acache code path
- kernel bugfixes:
  - don't attempt to shrink the sb's dcache on device close in the
    case that the sb has not yet been filled
  - translate error codes that occurred while waiting for the
    downcall, rather than assuming an error came back from the
    downcall (in the case that it didn't); fixes a possible oops on
    invalid mounts
  - use fully 64-bit op tags instead of relying on unreliable casts
    and assumptions moving from kernel space to userspace; changes use
    of an atomic_t type to a spinlock protected int64_t; works on ppc
    without problems now
- changed pre-posted write_ack recv posting to have an infinite
  timeout that is reset on flow completion to avoid timeouts before
  operation completion
- fixed crash bugs on (unexpected) job expiration in various places
- fixed crash bugs when an invalid (or unsupported) encoding type is
  specified by reporting the error to the user, and the completing the
  operation if possible by cycling through the valid encoders
- added pvfs2tab support for the line encoding=default

- general cleanup of API used for system interface initialization,
  including tabfile parsing
