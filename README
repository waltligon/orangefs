OrangeFS is a next generation parallel file system for Linux clusters (formerly PBFS2). It
harnesses commodity storage and network technology to provide concurrent
access to data that is distributed across a (possibly large) collection
of servers.  OrangeFS serves as both a testbed for parallel I/O research
and as a freely available production-level tool for the cluster community.

See the top level COPYING file for license information.

NOTE: The kernel module has been included in upstream linux since version 4.6 (please use the latest upstream version for best results).\
The out of tree modules for 2.4.x and 2.6.x to 4.6 are released under
the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and in this repo.
