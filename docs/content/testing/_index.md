The OrangeFS team is currently using the IO500 benchmark for performance
testing. For more information about the benchmark, please visit the
[IO500 website](https://io500.org/about) or
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/IO500/io500).

We have created a separate project to simplify the process of launching
a testing environment and running the benchmark. It can be used to
quickly create a user-customizable environment in Google Cloud that is
pre-configured with all the necessary software and settings for both
OrangeFS and IO500 and to automatically run the benchmark after the
environment is launched. For more information about this project,
including detailed installation and usage instructions, please refer to
the project README in the GitHub repo located here:
<https://github.com/omnibond/orangefs-io500>.
