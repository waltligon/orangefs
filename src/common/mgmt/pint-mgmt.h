/**
 * @defgroup pint-mgmt
 * 
 * The PVFS management interfaces provide abstraction for posting and testing
 * operations, and allowing them to be serviced via different methods,
 * both blocking and asynchronous (using different models such as 
 * thread pools or queues).  An 'operation' is a unit of work defined by
 * the caller via a callback function.  The management interfaces allow
 * callers to hand off these units of work, ignore the details of how
 * and when the operation is serviced, and test for completion later.
 *
 * Use of the API is done by creating a 'manager',
 * which provides a common reference for all the operations that should 
 * be grouped together somehow.  To a manager are added 'workers', which
 * specify how an operation is serviced.  Some examples of worker types are
 * 'per-op', which creates a thread for that operation and services it,
 * 'blocking', which blocks on the post call, services the operation and
 * returns, or 'threaded-queues', which create a number of threads and
 * pull operations off queues in-turn to service them.  Finally, once a 
 * manager has been setup with the appropriate workers, operations can 
 * be posted to the manager.  The worker that services the operation
 * is chosen either explicitly in the post call, or dynamically using
 * the type of the operation as the key.  Notification
 * of completed operations is made through the completion context,
 * which is specified for a particular manager, or passed in with the
 * post call.

/* This enum is an problem waiting to happen.  There are several sets
 * of similar constants: TROVE_OP_..., DBPF_OP_..., OP_..., and these.
 * Some of them have been unified (TROVE and DBPF).  The problem is
 * these are all integer return codes for functions, but the same
 * numerical values have different meanings.  These should either be
 * unified with the others, or assigned numerical values that are
 * distinct.  Of course if code is referencing them by number, that
 * screws the whole thing up - which is why I haven't fixed this yet.
