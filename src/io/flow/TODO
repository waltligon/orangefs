general stuff:
--------------------------

- do a better implementation of testsome(), so that it is more
  clever about dividing time between multiple modules and
  splitting up the max_idle_time_ms argument

- make an optional flow descriptor checker function that makes sure the
  flow descriptor fields are set to sane initial values - only use it
  during development

- probably should get rid of alloca calls, not sure if portable
  (would be faster to keep static buffers for some of that anyway if
  possible)

- implement unpost()

- think about how flow timeouts should be handled.  For example,
  suppose the sender experiences a BMI error and aborts.  The
  receiver may sit there indefinitely waiting for the next message
  if no one makes it time out.

- fix error handling.  Document how errors are reported, what short
  flows mean, etc.

flowproto bmi_trove stuff:
--------------------------

- do a better implementation of checkworld, so that it is more
  clever about multiplexing between bmi/trove and dividing up the
  max_idle_time.

- finish implementing ability to test multiple collections, remove
  HACK_global_fsid

- handle corner cases (look for "TODO" entries in code); mostly error
  conditions and short I/O conditions that we can't clean up right now

- create client side build target that doesn't include trove stuff (and
  also doesn't need ldb or lpthread)
