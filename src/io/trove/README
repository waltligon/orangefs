Hey,

The Makefiles include directories on my local machine, yes, but they
link to existing packages, such as the DB library (version 3 or 4),
which he can install wherever.  So that's not a problem.

If you look at the test programs in src/io/trove/test/, in particular
trove-mkfs.c, you'll see how the functions get called.  The functions
available for the most part match exactly with what is described in
doc/pvfs2-design-storageint/storage-interface.tex.  There are some
management operations that are NOT described in that document, and that
might be confusing.

The code in src/io/trove/ is basically wrapper code to handle mapping
to a particular instance of a trove implementation.  The code in
src/io/trove/trove_dbpf is the only existing implementation.  It is
described in doc/pvfs2-trove-dbpf/trove-dbpf.tex.
