# A brief description of the contents of the test/automated directory


From time to time we (pvfs2 developers) make an effort to thouroughly
test pvfs2.  We really do think it's important... it just ends up taking
a back seat to lots of other important items.   

CURRENT APPROACH:

  It would be hard to describe this as "minimally invasive".  We want to
  test the VFS interface in addition to the libpvfs and mpi-io
  interfaces, so we need significant modifications to the host machine.
  At MCS, we have 'gil' and 'lain', two "red" machines (machines on
  which we have root acces and no support from our system
  adminitrators).  

  The scripts require occaional root access, so it's best to set up sudo
  with a NOPASSWD entry (i.e. a line like "robl    ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL" in
  /etc/sudoers).  

  The main driver is 'testscrpt.sh' (name subject to change).  It
  builds pvfs2, starts up the servers, loads the kernel module, and
  starts pvfs2-client and pvfs2-client-core.   The script needs a few
  variables set:

    PVFS2_DEST:       staging location for checking out, building, logging
    PVFS2_MOUNTPOINT: where we mount pvfs2
    EXTRA_TESTS:      directory where more sophisticated benchmarks (like
                      bonnie, iozone, ior, etc) live

  Then it proceeds to run every executable file in 'sysint-tests.d',
  'vfs-tests.d' and 'mpiio-tests.d' These files are simple little shell
  scripts that do something to exercise pvfs2.  

  Sam set up a tinderbox on lain.mcs.anl.gov, and wrote
  tinder-pvfs2-status to make it easy for scripts to lob bits at it.   A
  couple things that tripped me up when I first started using it:

  - The states are enumerated in 'BuildStatus.pm' in the tinderbox
    directory.  
  - there seems to be a 6 minute interval where if you start a new run
    you'll overwrite the old run

On a Cluster:
  The common way to deploy PVFS2 on a cluster is through our pav
  scripts.  Thus, we need a pav config file, specified by the PAV_CONFIG
  variable.  We also want to run the usual battery of tests

OLDER APPROACHES:

These files aren't used anymore but might provide someone with some
useful ideas on how to script up a benchmark and interact with PBS.  If
anybody wants to document them, feel free to elaborate on this section.
