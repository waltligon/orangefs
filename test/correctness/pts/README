# PVFS Testing Suite: PTS

# Test harness structure

PTS is an MPI program that is responsible for running a suite of tests
based on a user supplied config file.  The system is also designed
with the intention of making it trivial to add new tests.  This README
outlines how to set up PTS and a PTS config file, as well as how to
design/include your own tests.

# Setting up PTS

PTS only requires that you have a functional MPI devel/execution
environment.  The system was designed and tested using mpich-1.2.3
from ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich-1.2.3.tar.gz.

After untarring the PTS tarball, inspect the Makefile to adjust the
mpicc path and any other site specific options that are necessary for
your site.  Run 'make'. The binary created is called 'pts' and is the
only relevant binary in the entire system.  All tests are compiled
into this binary.  Once compiled, one must create a config file with
the following form:

<test name>:<args>

See the file 'sample.conf' for a sample config file that runs a few
included tests.  Once all is set up, a command resembling the following will execute the test suite:

mpirun -np 2 -machinefile <somemachines> ./pts -conf sample.conf If
you are only running tests that execute on one host, you can run pts
without mpirun.


# Writing a PTS Test

The PTS test environment gives the test programmer a lot of
flexibility.  All tests must be written in C.  Each test must have a
prototype that takes the following form:

int function_name(MPI_Comm *mycomm, int myid, char *buf, void *rawparams);

The 'mycomm' variable is set to an MPI_Comm allocated specifically for
this test so as not to impact the harness communicator.  The 'myid' is
of course the MPI id of the process running the function.  The 'buf'
variable is space for storing text output from the test.  Finally the
'rawparams' variable is a pointer to a structure containing parameter
information about this specific test.

As a test programmer, one can take two routes:

a.) write a test function and use the generic parameter structure

b.) define a custom parameter struct, write a parameter struct parser,
and write a test function.

For a.), all one must do is write a test function and rely on the
generic parameter structure, which currently contains a member 'path'
and a member 'mode', the values of which are specified in the pts
config file.  For instance, a sample test function follows:

int test_function(MPI_Comm *mycomm, int myid, char *buf, void *params) {
  generic_params *myparams = (generic_params *)params;

  fprintf(stderr, "%d: Trying to barrier on mycomm...\n", myid);
  MPI_Barrier(*mycomm);

  fprintf(stderr, "%d: here are my params: mode %d path %s\n",myid, 
          myparams->mode, myparams->path);

  return(0);
}

You must #include 'mpi.h' and 'pts.h' to get your test to compile
correctly.

If you decide to write your own parameter parser/parameter structure,
you must handle the parsing yourself.  The parameter parser function
will be called with in the following form:

void *test_simple_mkdir_param_init(char *);

The function will take a string (defined in the config file) and must
return a pointer to your parameter struct.  An example of a parameter
structure, parameter parser, and test function follows:

/* Paramter struct */
typedef struct test_simple_mkdir_params_t {
  int mode;
  char *path;
  int myvalue;
} test_simple_mkdir_params;

/* Parameter parser */
void *test_simple_mkdir_param_init(char *paramstr) {
  test_simple_mkdir_params *myparams = malloc(sizeof(test_simple_mkdir_params));
  char *tmpbuf = malloc(4096);
  
  sscanf(paramstr, "%d %s %d\n", &myparams->mode, tmpbuf, &myparams->myvalue);
  myparams->path = (char *)str_malloc(tmpbuf);

  free(tmpbuf);
  return(myparams);

}

/* Test function itself */
int test_simple_mkdir(MPI_Comm *mycomm, int myid, char *buf, void *params) {
  test_simple_mkdir_params *myparams = (test_simple_mkdir_params *)params;
  
  printf("%d: my params %d %s %d\n", myid, myparams->mode, myparams->path, myparams->value);
  return(0);
}



# Adding a Test

Once your test code is written, it is trivial to add it to the PTS
test harness.  Just follow the two steps below:

1.) add the test code to the Makefile.  This is done by simply adding
a 'test_function.o' line to the 'TESTS' variable at the top of the
Makefile.

2.) add a member to the test_types enum to represent your test (it's 
going to be an index into the testpool array

3.) add a pointer to the test function/param parser to test_protos.h.
You will see a function 'setup_ptstests()' defined in test_protos.h,
simply add an 'entry' for your new test.  Following is how we would
add the test_simple_mkdir test from above:


  myconfig->testpool[TEST_SIMPLE_MKDIR].test_func = (void *)test_simple_mkdir;	
  myconfig->testpool[TEST_SIMPLE_MKDIR].test_param_init = (void *)test_simple_mkdir_param_init;
  myconfig->testpool[TEST_SIMPLE_MKDIR].test_name = str_malloc("test_simple_mkdir");

'test_name' should be the 'test name' part of your config file entry

If your test does not require a custom parameter parser, simply leave
out the line defining what test_param_init points to (you will get the
default param parser).

Have Fun!
