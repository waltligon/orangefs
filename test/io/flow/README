flow test programs:
=============================

These programs are divided into two categories, client and server.  

The server programs are:
test-harness-server       (receives data into memory and discards)
test-harness-server-trove (receives data and stores into trove)

The client programs are:
test-harness-client            (sends data from memory)
test-harness-client-from-trove (sends data from trove)

All four run on localhost.  Just start one of the two servers in one 
terminal, then start one of the clients in the other terminal.  Both
will exit after completing the flow transfer.

The test programs that interact with trove require that you have a 
trove storage space at /tmp/pvfs2-test-space, and a file system
named "pvfs2-fs".  These are the defaults in the pvfs2 development 
tree, so simply creating a pvfs2 file system in advance is enough
to prepare trove for running these tests.

The following programs are broken at this time, please do not use:
wire-harness-server
wire-harness-client

to use a different flow protocol:
============================
- modify the PINT_flow_initialize() calls to reflect the correct
  module name
- set the flow descriptor "type" field to the correct PVFS_flowproto_type
  value from pvfs2-types.h
